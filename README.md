# Masakhane Message Board

This is an experiment in being able to view the "small" community todos or requests for help, opening up communities ability to build together. If you're interested in starting a BIG initiative that needs help on, then we recommend adding it to our [meeting agenda](https://github.com/masakhane-io/weekly-meeting-agenda) instead. 

## How this works?

### Have a task you require assistance with?
Search our open issues to find if someone has the same problem. 
- If you find someone else, vote on that task with :+1:. This lets us know that this is something people should pick up!
- If you're working on something and need help with it, create a new issue from one of our templates. 

Tasks include (but are not limited to):
- Helping run code or getting started
- Helping find others working on same language/task as you
- Help needed in data annotation and creation
- Help needed for documentation
- Help required in understand how an algorithm works

### Want to help communities?

- Scan our list of open issues. To understand each issues priorities, look how many upvotes the tasks have and feel free to ask questions or self-assign
- We also appreciate help with admin, help us label our bugs and tasks with their context of priority! 

## A guide on creating a new issue

We're putting together some templates for the issues, in the meantime, let's keep it simple:

- Title:
- Description:
- Preferred contact place: (via github/slack/email etc)

We have created some tags for you to label your issue with, so please label your task with the relevant things!
